## Using Benchmarks

You can easily run these benchmarks yourself. After forking/cloning the repository:

1. Install dependencies with `yarn`
2. Run `yarn benchmark` to begin the benchmark tests.

## Exported Benchmarks?

Yes, you can export the benchmark test results, but what are they for? For now, nothing. Eventually, we would like to use these benchmark results to run a workflow to ensure that each benchmark test is up to par with our speed standards.

### Why?

Simply, this is a very viable way of ensuring that all our providers will perform well for our end-users.
